## Description
_This is a website for the Assassin game._

## Setup/Installation Requirements: Database

_To download and import the database:_

* _Start MAMP and click Open WebStart page in the MAMP window._
* _In the website you're taken to, select phpMyAdmin from the Tools dropdown._
* _Select the Import tab._
* _Note that it's important to make sure you're not importing to a database that already exists, so make sure that a database with the same name as the one you're importing isn't already present._
* _Select your database file, and click Go._

_To make your own database in MySql shell:_

* _CREATE DATABASE assassins;_
* _USE assassins;_
* _CREATE TABLE contracts (id serial PRIMARY KEY, game_id INT, assassin_id INT, contract_start DATETIME, contract_end DATETIME, is_fulfilled INT, weapon TEXT);_
* _CREATE TABLE games (id serial PRIMARY KEY, team_name TEXT, password TEXT, is_start INT, is_end INT);_
* _CREATE TABLE players (id serial PRIMARY KEY, is_alive INT, assassin_id INT, name TEXT, password TEXT, email TEXT, code_name TEXT, game_id INT, spoon_score INT, sock_score INT, phone_number TEXT, image_url TEXT, is_admin INT);_

## Setup/Installation Requirements: Program

* _Open via GitHub repository by going to <https://github.com/BrookeZK/Assassin>._
* _In your command line (Terminal or another program), navigate to your desktop._
* _In your command line, type "git clone https://github.com/BrookeZK/Assassin" to clone the repository to your desktop._
* _Open MAMP, or your equivalent. Start your servers. Navigate to the "Import" tab, and choose assassin.sql in the top level of the Assassin folder. Click "go" to import this database._
* _In your command line, navigate into the new folder "Assassin", then into the subfolder "Assassin"._
* _Once inside "Assassin," type "dotnet run", and your terminal will inform you that the program is running on <http://localhost:5000>._

## Known Bugs

* URL security; any user can navigate through URLs into restricted views without any authentication given they know correct routing values
* IsGameOver() with one player will never evaluated to true and end the game. There must always be (n > 1) players.
* Using numbers as agent names confuses some of the Model references and will create infinite contract generation loops, resulting in an unwinnable game
* End game accolades ignore ties for kill-count awards and will grab the first instance without a tiebreaker or split
* Lots of missing authentication checks for form inputs throughout
